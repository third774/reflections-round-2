# Lesson 3 Reflections

## 1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

>1. Collablorating with others
>2. Making source code available to the public as open source
>3. When you want to have a backup of your code off your local machine

## 2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

>Someone else could push a change that breaks everything, or just what you're working on.

## 3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

>* A Branch is a pointer to a commit, and exists within the context of a repository. Branches can be used for new features, experimental changes, refactoring, and other similar uses.
>* A Clone is a copy of a repository. You might create a clone of a repository when you want to take the code, and make changes to it in such a way that make it diverge completely from the original.
>* A Fork is similar to a clone in that it is also a copy of a repository, however, the point of forking is to explicitly attribute the repository that it was cloned from.

## 4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

>You can tell your local branch's relative position to the origin/master branch, and whether or not you're out of sync. This can be helpful to know before attempting a merge, or a push.

## 5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?
