# Lesson 2 Reflections

## 1. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is aptly named, as it allows you to select the exact files that you wish to include with your commit before actually going through with it.

## 2. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only stage the files that have changes relevant to the logical change you are making. Also, make sure the files only contain changes relevant to the logical change you are making. If you are working on multiple changes in the same files, consider creating branches for each logical change.
